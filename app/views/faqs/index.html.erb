      <h3>How is the competition scored?</h3>
      The scoring system used in this competition is a detailed framework designed to assign numerical values to different stages and outcomes of the tournament. The competition unfolds across several stages, each contributing uniquely to the overall score of participants.<br>
<br>
Initially, teams compete in group stages, where advancing beyond the group phase earns a valued point. This initial phase sets the stage for subsequent advancements, where victories in further stages—namely the Round of 16, Quarter Finals, Semi Finals, and Bronze Finals—are equally prized with a single scoring point each.<br>
<br>
Significant importance is placed on reaching and excelling in the tournament's ultimate stage, the Grand Final. In this culminating phase, various outcomes—such as losses, which still acknowledge participation and effort—are credited with a single point. Conversely, a triumph in the Final, representing the peak of achievement and ultimate supremacy, is esteemed and distinctly recognized with a higher scoring allocation of two points.<br>
<br>
In summary, this intricate scoring framework is carefully crafted to reward progress, persistence, and ultimately, the pinnacle of competitive success across the tournament's diverse stages. It mirrors the strategic and nuanced essence of the competition's scoring methodology.

      <h3>Why is the sky blue?</h3>
      <p>The sky appears blue due to the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere. This scattering preferentially affects shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, making the sky appear blue during the day.</p>
